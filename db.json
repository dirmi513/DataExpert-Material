This introductory course will cover the basics of the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is required, as we will teach you all that you need to know to become a competent Python programmer, with a specific focus on data science use cases. Not only is Python one of the most popular programming language amongst data experts (Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers), it is one of the most popular programming languages out there! In fact, according to GitHub's 2019 annual developer survey, known as Octoverse, \"Python outranked Java as the second most popular language on GitHub by repository contributors.\"<br><br>If this is your first foray into the world of computer programming, learning Python is an excellent programming language to begin with because it is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language\" target=\"_blank\">general-purpose</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language\" target=\"_blank\">high-level</a> programming language. In short, Python can be used to accomplish a wide array of distinct tasks (general-purpose), and it is fairly straightforward to understand and write Python code, as the language implementation <a href=\"https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Abstraction\" target=\"_blank\">abstracts</a> a lot of the complexities associated with how the code is actually executed (high-level). This allows you to easily write code that will do what you want in a simple and understandable manner.<br><br> Each one of our lessons is structured in a way that will allow you to:<ul><li>learn new concepts</li><li>build upon previous concepts</li><li>apply your newfound knowledge via interactive coding challenges and guided projects</li></ul>A single lesson within a course is composed of multiple slides. The majority of slides will contain a text editor for you to write your code, buttons for you to be able to execute your code and check whether or not you completed the coding challenge correctly, and an output area that will display the results of your code being executed. This way you will stay engaged, interested, and be able to retain as much information as possible. The course material is dense, yet succinct, and we try to break down complex topics into simple and understandable chunks. The difficulty of the material will increase steadily, giving you the opportunity to slowly accumulate the skill-set and knowledge necessary to complete our guided projects and eventually get a job!<br><br>Throughout our lessons you will see that certain words and phrases link to an article or documentation online, which will provide a more in depth explanation of that topic. We highly suggest that you dedicate some time to do this extra reading, as it will help you gain a better understanding of the whys and hows. If we come across an article that does a great job of explaining an important topic and/or goes into greater depth on it than we do, we will link you to it. In addition, everything Python related is documented online, and being able to understand this documentation is an indispensable skill that will go a long way. If the documentation seems intimidating and overwhelming at first, do not feel discouraged. As you gain more knowledge and experience while going through our lessons, you will slowly gain the ability to decipher more complex technical information, such as programming documentation. Remember, Rome was not built in a day, and you will not become a data expert in a day. With hard work, dedication, and persistence, everything will come together and you will prevail. Please be patient, stay excited, and get ready to become a true DataExpert!

The most basic of these tasks are arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. To perform these calculations, we have to let the computer know (by giving it commands):</p><ul><li>which numbers to perform the calculation(s) on</li><li>which calculation(s) to perform</li></ul><p>For the second bullet point above, we make use of Python\u2019s <b>arithmetic operators</b>, which perform calculations on two or more numbers, known as <b>operands</b>. Before we continue, we want to point out that any text within a slide with a light gray background, such as <code>print('hello world')</code>, is Python code. Now back to arithmetic operators:</p><ul><li> Addition Operator: <code> + </code> <ul class=\"code-list\"> <li> <code>6 + 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Subtraction Operator: <code> - </code> <ul class=\"code-list\"><li> <code>6 - 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Multiplication Operator: <code> * </code> <ul class=\"code-list\"><li> <code>6 * 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Division Operator: <code> / </code> <ul class=\"code-list\"><li> <code>6 / 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Exponentiation Operator: <code> ** </code> <ul class=\"code-list\"><li> <code>6 ** 2</code> , which is 6 to the power of 2, or 36.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to the five basic arithmetic operators above, Python supports two other, less commonly known arithmetic operators:</p><ul><li> Floor Division Operator: <code> // </code> <ul><li> This operator returns the maximum number of times that one number, lets call it x, can be evenly divided by another number, y. When we say evenly, we mean without anything left over. </li><ul class=\"code-list\"><li><code>10 // 2</code> would return 5, as 10 can be evenly divided by 2 only 5 times: 10 = 2 x 5</li><li><code>10 // 3</code> would return 3, as 10 can be evenly divided by 3 a maximum of 3 times, and there would be a remainder of 1: 10 = (3 x 3) + 1</li><li><code>5 // 10</code> would return 0. This is a tricky one, but the reasoning is that 5 cannot be evenly divided by 10 any number of times. Another way to put is that there is no integer greater than 0 for which 10 times that integer would get you a value less than or equal to 5. So for the floor division operator, if the number to the right is greater than the number to the left, the result will always be 0.</li>\n</ul></ul></li> <li> Modulus Operator: <code> % </code> <ul><li> In contrast to the floor division operator, this operator returns the remainder after attempting to divide one number, x, by another number, y. Although, if x is less than y, then the result would just be x itself.</li><ul class=\"code-list\"><li><code>10 % 2</code> would return 0 since there is no remainder when dividing 10 by 2.</li><li><code>10 % 3</code> would return 1, as there is a remainder of 1 when dividing 10 by 3.</li> <li><code>5 % 10</code> would return 5 because 5 is less than 10.</li></ul></ul></li> </ul><p>The rules above for the floor division and modulus operators will always hold when <strong>both</strong> operands are positive. Things get weird when you start using negative numbers, and we highly doubt that you will ever have to use negative numbers with these two operators. <br><br> For arithmetic operations, the operands can be:</p><ul><li> Integers - whole numbers without a decimal point<ul><li>50, 2, -100, 5, 234 </li></ul></li> <li> Floating Point Numbers (aka Floats) - numbers with a decimal point<ul><li>1.452, 3.14, 0.75653, 123.7</li></ul></li></ul><p>There are also special cases where we can use arithmetic operators with non-numeric data, and you will learn about this later on in the course. Lastly, we can make use of multiple arithmetic operators on a combination of integers and floats, and in a single command:</p> <ul class=\"code-list\"><li><code>5.7 * 10 - 2.5 + 3</code></li><li><code>5 ** 2 / 5 + 40.8</code></li></ul><hr class=\"hr-challenge\"><h3 class=\"coding-challenge-heading\"> Coding Challenge </h2> <p> When writing out a single, or sequence, of Python commands (also known as <a href=\"https://techterms.com/definition/sourcecode\" target=\"_blank\">source code</a>) to be executed, we usually do so in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor\" target=\"_blank\">source code editor</a>. As you have probably already noticed, there is a source code editor on the top right hand side of the screen. This is where you will write all of your code while going through the lessons. </p><p>Right below the source code editor, there is a row of buttons that you will be using quite frequently:</p><ul><li><b>Execute Code</b> - this button will execute all of the code that you have written in the source code editor, and then display the results on the bottom right hand portion of your screen. </li> <li><b>Submit Answer</b> - this button will do the same as the Execute Code button, but will also check to see if you answered the coding challenge question(s) correctly. </li> <li><b>Restore Code</b> - this is the circular, light green button to the right of the Submit Answer button. If you click it and then click Restore Code in the pop-up box that will appear, any code that you wrote and is currently in the source code editor for the slide that you are on will be replaced with the default code for that slide. The default code for a slide is either no code at all, or preset code that we create, which you will see on the screen the first time you come to a slide. </li> </ul><p>For this coding challenge, please enter the following command in the source code editor, and then press the Submit Answer button:</p> <ul><li> <code> print(20 * 3 + 150) </code></li> </ul><p>Congratulations on writing your first line of code! </p>", "codedSlide": "T", "correctAnswer": "print(20 * 3 + 150)", "hint": null}}, {"model": "courses.courselessonslidemaster", "pk": 113, "fields": {"course": "Introduction to Python Programming", "courseNumber": 1, "lessonNumber": 1, "slideNumber": 3, "lesson": "Introductory Python", "slide": "Print Expression", "defaultCode": "", "htmlBody": "<h2 class=\"slide-header\">Print Function</h2><p>For the previous slide's coding challenge, the command that you had to execute was <code>print(20 * 3 + 150)</code>. This command utilized Python\u2019s built-in <code>print()</code> function (we will explore functions in great depth later on). What happened behind the scenes when you executed <code>print(20 * 3 + 150)</code>? <ol><li> Python first performed the calculations within the parenthesis, <code>20 * 3 + 150</code>. The order of operations in Python is determined by <a href= \"https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html \" target= \"_blank \">PEMDAS</a>: <ul> <li> First, 20 was multiplied by 3 to get 60. </li> <li> Then, 150 was added that product of 60 to get the final value of 210. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>print(210)</code> was executed, which instructs Python to display the value that is within the parenthesis of <code>print(210)</code> on your screen. </li> </ol> <p> If you had just entered <code>20 * 3 + 150</code> into the text editor without using the <code>print()</code> function, Python would still perform the calculations behind the scenes, but result would <b>not</b> be displayed on the screen. That is why we use the <code>print()</code> function. <br><br> Every distinct command in your source code <strong>must</strong> be separated by a new line. For example, if you want to use the print function more than once: </p> <div align= \"center \"> <img src= \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/3+-+Print+Expression/print_1.png \" style= \"width:201px; height:181px; \"> </div> <br> <p> As you can see above: </p> <ul> <li> There are multiple, distinct arithmetic expressions, and each one is contained in a separate <code>print()</code> function. </li> <li> Each time the <code>print()</code> function is used, it is on a new line in the source code editor. Please note that it does not matter if the next <code>print()</code> function is on the line directly below the current one, or five lines down, as long as it is on a new line. </li> <li> The output of executing the source code displays the resulting value of each expression in the same order as the commands are written in the source code. Python executes your source code from top to bottom. </li> </ul> <p> If there are multiple <code>print()</code> functions on the same line in the source code, Python will display the following error message when we try to execute the code: </p> <div align= \"center \"> <img src= \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/3+-+Print+Expression/print_2.png \" style= \"width:420px; height:142px; \"> </div> <br> <p> The great thing about Python is that it always tries to give us enough information to be able to dissect the issue(s) in our code.

This is also the case for all programming languages. Each unique programming language is analogous to a human language, and requires adherence to specific grammar, also known as syntax, rules. These syntax rules define whether or not your code is properly written, and if it is not, you will most definitely get a <code>SyntaxError</code> when trying to execute the code. Some of Python's syntax rules that you have already come across (explicitly and implicitly) are that: </p> <ul><li>Every distinct command must be separated by a new line in your source code.<ul><li>In the previous slide, we showed you the output (<code>SyntaxError</code>) of trying to execute code that had two consecutive <code>print()</code> functions separated by a space instead of a new line. </li> </ul> </li> <li> To properly utilize a function within your source code, it must be written in the following format: <code>name_of_function(function arguments)</code>. <ul> <li> Lets use <code>print(5 + 5)</code> as an example.

Similar to speaking and writing in a natural language, as you become a more experienced coder, writing syntactically accurate code gets easier.

In the image above, you can see that <code>'This is a string containing '</code> is a light green color, indicating that it is a string.  The interpreter mistakenly interpreted this smaller portion of the whole string we intended to create as the full string.  The same thing would happen if we tried including double quotes within a string delimited by double quotes.  So how can we get around this?  There are a few options.\n            </p> \n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    For a string that will only contain single or double quotes, just enclose the string in the other type of quotation marks.  For example, \n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            If you want a string to only include single quotes, enclose the string in double quotes:\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <code>\n                                        \"This is a string that contains 'single quotes' and is enclosed in double quotes.\"\n                                    </code>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul> \n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            If you want a string to only include double quotes, enclose the string in single quotes: \n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <code>\n                                        'This is a string that contains \"double quotes\" and is enclosed in single quotes.'\n                                    </code>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    You can <i>escape</i> quotes within a string by using the backslash <code>\\</code> character.
