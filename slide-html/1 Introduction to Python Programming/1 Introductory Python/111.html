<h2 class="slide-header"> Course Overview </h2>

<p>
    Welcome to DataExpert, and congratulations on the start of your journey to becoming a data expert!
    This introductory course will cover the basics of the Python programming language.
    No prior programming experience is required, as we will teach you all that you need to know to become a competent
    Python programmer, with a specific focus on data science use cases.
    Not only is Python one of the most popular programming language amongst data experts (Data Analysts, Data
    Scientists, Data Engineers), it is one of the most popular programming languages out there!
    In fact, according to GitHub's 2019 annual developer survey, known as Octoverse, "Python outranked Java as the
    second most popular language on GitHub by repository contributors."

<p>
    If this is your first foray into the world of computer programming, learning Python is an excellent programming
    language to begin with because it is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language" target="_blank">general-purpose</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language" target="_blank">high-level</a> programming language.
    In short, Python can be used to accomplish a wide array of distinct tasks (general-purpose),
    and it is fairly straightforward to understand and write Python code, as the language implementation
    <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Abstraction" target="_blank">abstracts</a>
    a lot of the complexities associated with how the code is actually executed (high-level).
    This allows you to easily write code that will do what you want in a simple and understandable manner.
</p>

<p>
    Each one of our lessons is structured in a way that will allow you to:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>learn new concepts</li>
        <li>build upon previous concepts</li>
        <li>apply your newfound knowledge via interactive coding challenges and guided projects </li>
    </ul>

<p>
    A single lesson within a course is composed of multiple slides.
    The majority of slides will contain a source code editor for you to write your code, buttons for you to be able
    to execute your code and check whether or not you completed the coding challenge correctly, and an output area
    that will display the results of your code being executed.
    This way you will stay engaged, interested, and be able to retain as much information as possible.
    The course material is dense, yet succinct, and we try to break down complex topics into simple and understandable chunks.
    The difficulty of the material will increase steadily, giving you the opportunity to slowly accumulate the skill-set and
    knowledge necessary to complete our guided projects and eventually get a job!
</p>

<p>
    Throughout our lessons you will see that certain words and phrases link to an article or documentation online,
    which will provide a more in depth explanation of that topic.
    We highly suggest that you dedicate some time to do this extra reading, as it will help you gain a better
    understanding of the whys and hows.
    If we come across an article that does a great job of explaining an important topic and/or goes into greater depth
    on it than we do, we will link you to it.
    In addition, everything Python related is documented online, and being able to understand this documentation is an
    indispensable skill that will go a long way.
    If the documentation seems intimidating and overwhelming at first, do not feel discouraged.
    As you gain more knowledge and experience while going through our lessons, you will slowly gain the ability to
    decipher more complex technical information, such as programming documentation.
    Remember, Rome was not built in a day, and you will not become a data expert in a day.
    With hard work, dedication, and persistence, everything will come together and you will prevail.
    Please be patient, stay excited, and get ready to become a true DataExpert! Now, let's get started.
