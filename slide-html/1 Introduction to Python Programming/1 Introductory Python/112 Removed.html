    In addition to the five basic arithmetic operators above, Python supports two other, less commonly known arithmetic operators:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Floor Division Operator: <code> // </code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This operator returns the maximum number of times that one number, lets call it x, can be evenly divided
                by another number, y. When we say evenly, we mean without anything left over.
                <ul class="code-list">
                    <li>
                        <code>10 // 2</code> would return 5, as 10 can be evenly divided by 2 only 5 times: 10 = 2 x 5
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code>10 // 3</code> would return 3, as 10 can be evenly divided by 3 a maximum of 3 times, and
                        there would be a remainder of 1: 10 = (3 x 3) + 1</li><li><code>5 // 10</code> would return 0.
                    This is a tricky one, but the reasoning is that 5 cannot be evenly divided by 10 any number of times.
                    Another way to put is that there is no integer greater than 0 for which 10 times that integer would get
                    you a value less than or equal to 5. So for the floor division operator, if the number to the right is
                    greater than the number to the left, the result will always be 0.
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Modulus Operator: <code> % </code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In contrast to the floor division operator, this operator returns the remainder after attempting to
                divide one number, x, by another number, y. Although, if x is less than y, then the result would just be
                x itself.
                <ul class="code-list">
                    <li>
                        <code>10 % 2</code> would return 0 since there is no remainder when dividing 10 by 2.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code>10 % 3</code> would return 1, as there is a remainder of 1 when dividing 10 by 3.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code>5 % 10</code> would return 5 because 5 is less than 10.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The rules above for the floor division and modulus operators will always hold when <strong>both</strong> operands
    are positive. Things get weird when you start using negative numbers, and we highly doubt that you will ever have
    to use negative numbers with these two operators. <br><br>
