<h2 class="slide-header">Arithmetic Operations</h2>

<p>
    We write code in a programming language to instruct the computer to perform a single, or series, of tasks for us.
    The most basic of these tasks are arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
    To perform these calculations, we have to let the computer know (by giving it commands):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>which numbers to perform the calculation(s) on</li>
    <li>which calculation(s) to perform</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the second bullet point above, we make use of Pythonâ€™s <b>arithmetic operators</b>, which perform calculations
    on two or more numbers, known as <b>operands</b>.
    Before we continue, we want to point out that any text within a slide with a light gray background, such as
    <code>print('hello world')</code>, is Python code. Now back to arithmetic operators:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Addition Operator: <code> + </code>
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li> <code>6 + 2</code> </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Subtraction Operator: <code> - </code>
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li> <code>6 - 2</code> </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Multiplication Operator: <code> * </code>
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li> <code>6 * 2</code> </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Division Operator: <code> / </code>
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li> <code>6 / 2</code> </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Exponentiation Operator: <code> ** </code>
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li> <code>6 ** 2</code> , which is 6 to the power of 2, or 36.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p> For arithmetic operations, the operands can be: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Integers - whole numbers without a decimal point
        <ul>
            <li>50, 2, -100, 5, 234 </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Floating Point Numbers (aka Floats) - numbers with a decimal point
        <ul>
            <li>1.452, 3.14, 0.75653, 123.7
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    We can make use of multiple arithmetic operators on a combination of integers and floats, and in a single command:
</p>

<ul class="code-list">
    <li>
        <code>5.7 * 10 - 2.5 + 3</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>5 ** 2 / 5 + 40.8</code>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="coding-challenge-heading"> Coding Challenge </h3>

<p>
    When writing out a single, or sequence, of Python commands (also known as
    <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/sourcecode" target="_blank">source code</a>)
    to be executed, we usually do so in a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor" target="_blank">source code editor</a>.
    As you have probably already noticed, there is a source code editor on the top right hand side of the screen. This
    is where you will write all of your code while going through the lessons. </p>

<p>
    Right below the source code editor, there is a row of buttons that you will be using quite frequently:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Execute Code</b> - this button will execute all of the code that you have written in the source code editor,
        and then display the results on the bottom right hand portion of your screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Submit Answer</b> - this button will do the same as the Execute Code button, but will also check to see if you
        answered the coding challenge question(s) correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Restore Code</b> - this is the circular, light green button to the right of the Submit Answer button. If you
        click it and then click Restore Code in the pop-up box that will appear, any code that you wrote and is currently
        in the source code editor for the slide that you are on will be replaced with the default code for that slide. The
        default code for a slide is either no code at all, or preset code that we create, which you will see on the screen
        the first time you come to a slide.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    For this coding challenge, please enter the following command in the source code editor, and then press the Submit
    Answer button:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <code> print(20 * 3 + 150) </code>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations on writing your first line of code! </p>
