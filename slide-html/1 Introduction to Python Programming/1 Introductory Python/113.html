<h2 class="slide-header">Print Function</h2>

<p>
    For the previous slide's coding challenge, the command that you had to execute was <code>print(20 * 3 + 150)</code>.
    This command utilized Pythonâ€™s built-in <code>print()</code> function (we will explore functions in great depth later on).
    What happened behind the scenes when you executed <code>print(20 * 3 + 150)</code>?

<ol>
    <li>
        Python first performed the calculations within the parenthesis, <code>20 * 3 + 150</code>.
        The order of operations in Python is determined by
        <a href= "https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html " target= "_blank ">PEMDAS</a>:
        <ul>
            <li> First, 20 was multiplied by 3 to get 60. </li>

            <li> Then, 150 was added that product of 60 to get the final value of 210. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <code>print(210)</code> was executed, which instructs Python to display the value that is within the parenthesis
        of <code>print(210)</code> on your screen.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you had just entered <code>20 * 3 + 150</code> into the text editor without using the <code>print()</code> function,
    Python would still perform the calculations behind the scenes, but result would <b>not</b> be displayed on the screen.
    That is why we use the <code>print()</code> function.

    <br><br>

    Every distinct command in your source code <strong>must</strong> be separated by a new line. For example, if you want
    to use the print function more than once:
</p>

<div align="center ">
    <img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/3+-+Print+Expression/print_1.png " style= "width:201px; height:181px; ">
</div>

<br>

<p> As you can see above: </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        There are multiple, distinct arithmetic expressions, and each one is contained in a separate <code>print()</code> function.
    </li>

    <li>
        Each time the <code>print()</code> function is used, it is on a new line in the source code editor. Please note
        that it does not matter if the next <code>print()</code> function is on the line directly below the current one,
        or five lines down, as long as it is on a new line.
    </li>

    <li>
        The output of executing the source code displays the resulting value of each expression in the same order as the
        commands are written in the source code. Python executes your source code from top to bottom.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If there are multiple <code>print()</code> functions on the same line in the source code, Python will display the
    following error message when we try to execute the code:
</p>

<div align= "center">
    <img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/3+-+Print+Expression/print_2.png " style= "width:420px; height:142px; ">
</div>

<br>

<p>
    The great thing about Python is that it always tries to give us enough information to be able to dissect the issue(s)
    in our code. Here it is telling us:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Which line in the source code is causing the error - <code>line 1</code> </li>

    <li> The type of error - <code>SyntaxError</code> </li>

    <li> A brief description of the error - <code>invalid syntax</code> </li>
</ul>

<p> Syntax is the next topic that we will explore. </p>

<h3 class="coding-challenge-heading"> Coding Challenge </h3>

<p>
    For this challenge, your task is to create source code that will evaluate and display the results of the following
    <b>distinct</b> arithmetic expressions on the screen:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <code>(5 * 4.5) + 15</code> </li>
    <li> <code>10 / 3</code> </li>
    <li> <code>3 - 274.7 + 54</code> </li>
</ul>
