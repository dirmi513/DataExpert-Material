<h2 class="slide-header">Python Syntax</h2>

<p>
    Any natural language, such as English, has certain
    <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/" target="_blank"> grammar rules</a>
    that you must follow in order to construct valid sentences. This is also the case for all programming languages.
    Each unique programming language is analogous to a human language, and requires adherence to specific grammar,
    also known as syntax, rules. These syntax rules determine whether or not your code is properly written, and if it
    is not, you will most definitely get a <code>SyntaxError</code> when trying to execute the code. Some of Python's syntax rules
    that you have already come across (explicitly and implicitly) are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Every distinct command must be separated by a new line in your source code.
        <ul>
            <li>
                In the previous slide, we showed you the output (<code>SyntaxError</code>) of trying to execute code that
                had two consecutive <code>print()</code> functions separated by a space, instead of a new line.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        To properly utilize a function within your source code, it must be written in the following format:
        <code>name_of_function(function arguments)</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lets use <code>print(5 + 5)</code> as an example. The function's name is <code>print</code>, followed by
                an open parenthesis <code>(</code>, the arguments passed to the function (which we will cover in a later lesson)
                <code>5 + 5</code>, and finally a closing parenthesis <code>)</code>. What would happen if we used a
                close square bracket instead of parenthesis?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you can see, Python throws a <code>SyntaxError</code>. Now, what if we accidentally used a symbol that is not a valid
    arithmetic operator?

<p>
    Another <code>SyntaxError</code>, as you might have expected. In both of the examples above, Python tried pointing us
    to the exact location of the syntax error in our source code.

    <br><br>

    To avoid syntax errors, you must be diligent when writing code. We have just covered a few of Python's various syntax rules,
    but will continue to highlight proper Python syntax as new concepts are introduced. Similar to speaking and writing in a natural
    language, as you become a more experienced coder, writing syntactically accurate code gets easier. And for the times when there
    are syntax errors in your source code, Python will throw a <code>SyntaxError</code>, and try to point you to where the error occurred.
