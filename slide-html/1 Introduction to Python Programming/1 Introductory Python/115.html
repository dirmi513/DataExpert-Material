<h2 class="slide-header">Comments</h2>

<p>
    As you gain more experience writing code, the length and/or complexity of your code will increase.
    In addition, your code will potentially be looked at, used, and/or edited in the future, by either you, a colleague,
    or superior.
    This is where comments in your source code come in handy, as they allow you to explain what a certain portion of
    code is doing.

    <br><br>

    We can let Python know that a certain portion of the source code, either a single line, part of a single line, or
    multiple lines, contains text that should be ignored, i.e. comments, with the hashtag symbol <code>#</code>.
    As you already know, Python executes your source code line by line, from top to bottom.
    During execution, it ignores any text that comes after the hashtag symbol, which basically tells it "I am a
    comment, ignore me!"

    <br><br>

    Comments can be placed:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>on their own line within the text editor</li>
    <li>after a legit command </li>
</ul>

<p>Some things to note about using comments in your code:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you start a new line with a comment, and then on that same line start writing legitimate Python code,
        the interpreter will not execute any text on that line, including the portion that contains a valid command.
        It will consider all text on that line as a comment.
        For example, the interpreter will interpret the following line as a comment:
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li><code># start of a new line, which is a comment print(5 / 5)</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When placing a comment after a command on the same line, it's best practice to add a space (two is preferred)
        in between the end of the command and the start of the comment:
        <ul class="code-list">
            <li><code>print(5 / 5)  # this is a comment</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    How often should you include comments in your code?  There is no "right answer", but our suggestion would be to
    include them only when a portion your source code would be hard to interpret otherwise.
    Be aware though, as you don't want to overdo it.
    We will make use of comments in the default code for certain slides, and you can use this as a guide for when you
    want to include comments in your own source code.

    Feel free to experiment with the <code>print()</code> function and Python comments in the source code editor.
