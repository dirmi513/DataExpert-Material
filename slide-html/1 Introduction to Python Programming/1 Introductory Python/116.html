<p>\n        As you gain more experience writing code, the length and/or complexity of your code will increase.  In addition, code you write will potentially be looked at, used, or edited by either you or someone else.  This is where comments come in handy, as they allow you to explain what a certain portion of code is doing.\n        <br><br>\n        We make use of comments in Python with the hashtag symbol <code>#</code>.  As you already know, the interpreter executes your code line by line.  During execution, it ignores any text that comes after a hashtag, which tells it \"I am a comment, ignore me!\" \n        <br><br>\n        Comments can be placed:\n        <ul>\n            <li> on their own line within the text editor </li>\n            <li> after a legit command </li> \n        </ul>\n        <div align=\"center\">\n            <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/5+-+Comments/comment_1.png\" style=\"width:311px; height:133px;\">\n        </div>\n        <br>\n        <p>\n            Some things to note about using comments in your code:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                If you start a new line with a comment and then on that same line continue writing legitimate Python code, the interpreter will not execute the code.  It will consider it as being part of that comment.  For example, the interpreter will interpret the following line as a comment:\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <code># this is a comment print(5 / 5)</code>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                When placing a comment after a command on the same line, it's best practice to add a space or two in between the end of the command and the start of the comment:  \n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <code>print(5 / 5)  # this is a comment</code>\n                    </li>\n                </ul> \n            </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>  \n            How often should you include comments in your code?  There is no set amount, but our suggestion would be to include them only when you deem necessary.  Although, there is such a thing as too many comments.  You don't want to include them for code that can be easily understood by a competent programmer. \n        <br><br>    \n            We'll occasionally make use of comments in the default code for certain slides, and our guided projects solution code.  If you'd like, you can use these as a guide for including comments in your own code.  \n        <br><br>\n            Feel free to experiment with the <code>print()</code> function and Python comments in the text editor.  There is no coding challenge for this slide. \n        </p>
