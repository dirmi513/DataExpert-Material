<h2 class="slide-header">Summary</h2>

<p>
    Congratulations on completing your first DataExpert lesson!

    <br><br>

    Every lesson concludes with a summary slide that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Highlights and briefly summarizes key concepts from the lesson.</li>
    <li> Has links to articles and/or documentation for new terms introduced throughout the lesson.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="slide-header"> Key Concepts </h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Python is one of the most, if not the most, widely used programming languages.
        This is due to its versatility, ease of use, and continued support for almost all use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        Humans utilize programming languages to instruct the computer to perform specific commands,
        the most basic being arithmetic calculations.
        <ul>
            <li> To perform basic arithmetic in Python, you need to use its arithmetic operators:
                <code>+ - * / **</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>print()</code> function can be used to display numeric data, such as integers and floats.
        It can also be utilized do display other types of data that is non-numeric, which we will learn about in the
        next lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just like natural, human languages have grammar rules that define the structure of the language, programming
        languages have syntax rules.
        If you have incorrect syntax in your Python source code, i.e. <code>SyntaxError</code>, Python will not
        execute your code, but it will point you to the source of the error.
    </li>
    <li>
        We can make use of comments in our source code to make it easier to understand.
    </li>
</ul>
