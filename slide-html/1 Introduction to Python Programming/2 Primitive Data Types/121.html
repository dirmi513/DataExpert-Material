<p>      \n                We previously learned how to use Python as a calculator to perform operations on the integer and float numeric <i>data types</i>.  One data type differs from another in its features and/or the operations that can be performed on data of that data type.  For example, integers are whole numbers that you can perform arithmetical computations on.  You can also perform arithmetical computations on floats, but they are numbers that contain a decimal point.  \n            <br><br>\n                <i>Strings</i> are another one of Python's basic data types. A string is comprised of zero or more characters enclosed (delimited) in single <code>''</code> or double <code>\"\"</code> quotation marks.  There is no restriction on which characters, or the combination of characters that can be used to form a string. \n            <br><br> \n                Some examples of strings are:\n            </p>\n            <ul> \n                <li>\n                    <code>\"A\"</code> \n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <code>'Hello world'</code> \n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <code>\"12345\"</code> \n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <code>'The company's profits increased by $45,000.'</code> \n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <code>\"!@#$%^&*()%\"</code> \n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    <code>''</code> \n                </li> \n            </ul>\n            <p>\n                Sometimes you'll want to include single and/or double quotes within a string.  Remember that the Python interpreter determines if data is a string by looking for enclosing single or double quotes.  Therefore, including single (double) quote(s) in a string that is delimited by single (double) quotes will result in a <code>SyntaxError</code>:\n            </p> \n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Basic+Data+Types/Intro+to+Strings/strings_1.png\" style=\"width:489px; height:132px;\">\n            </div>\n            <br> \n            <p>\n                This is because the interpreter considers anything in between two quotation marks as a string, so it throws an error when you try including single quotes within a string that is delimited by single quotes.  In the image above, you can see that <code>'This is a string containing '</code> is a light green color, indicating that it is a string.  The interpreter mistakenly interpreted this smaller portion of the whole string we intended to create as the full string.  The same thing would happen if we tried including double quotes within a string delimited by double quotes.  So how can we get around this?  There are a few options.\n            </p> \n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    For a string that will only contain single or double quotes, just enclose the string in the other type of quotation marks.  For example, \n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            If you want a string to only include single quotes, enclose the string in double quotes:\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <code>\n                                        \"This is a string that contains 'single quotes' and is enclosed in double quotes.\"\n                                    </code>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul> \n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            If you want a string to only include double quotes, enclose the string in single quotes: \n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <code>\n                                        'This is a string that contains \"double quotes\" and is enclosed in single quotes.'\n                                    </code>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    You can <i>escape</i> quotes within a string by using the backslash <code>\\</code> character.  The backslash character can be used with certain characters to inform the interpreter to ignore, or escape, the usual interpretation of that character.    \n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            If you want to include single (double) quotes in a string delimited by single (double) quotes, insert a backslash character right before the single (double) quote(s) that are within that string:\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li> \n            </ul>\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Basic+Data+Types/Intro+to+Strings/strings_2.png\" style=\"width:377px; height:114px;\">\n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <p>\n                In addition, the backslash can be used on its own, or with other characters within a string for various purposes:\n            </p>\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Basic+Data+Types/Intro+to+Strings/strings_3.png\" style=\"width:451px; height:388px;\">\n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <p>\n            Finally, if you want to create a multiline string without having to use the <code>\n</code> escape sequence, you can enclose a string in triple single or double quotes.  The benefit of using triple quotes is that you can include both single and double quotes within the string without having to escape them.\n            </p>\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Basic+Data+Types/Intro+to+Strings/strings_4.png\" style=\"width:325px; height:186px;\">\n            </div>\n\n            <hr id=\"hrChallenge\">  \n            <h3 class=\"codingChallenge\"> Coding Challenge </h2>\n            <p>\n                In a previous lesson, we utilized Python's built-in <code>print()</code> function to display the output of various math computations.\n                <br><br>\n                We can also use this function to print strings - just put the string (with quotes) within the parentheses of the <code>print()</code> function.\n                <br><br>\n                For this challenge, print the following strings on the screen, in the order presented below:\n            </p> \n            <ul>\n                <li>Hello and welcome to data expert!</li>\n                <li>The correct \"term\" is data expert</li>\n                <li>If you're going to give it a try, give it your all</li>\n            </ul>
