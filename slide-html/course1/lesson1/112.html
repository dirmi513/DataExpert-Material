<h2 class="slide-header">Arithmetic Operations</h2><p>We write code in a programming language to instruct the computer to perform a single, or series, of tasks for us. The most basic of these tasks are arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. To perform these calculations, we have to let the computer know (by giving it commands):</p><ul><li>which numbers to perform the calculation(s) on</li><li>which calculation(s) to perform</li></ul><p>For the second bullet point above, we make use of Pythonâ€™s <b>arithmetic operators</b>, which perform calculations on two or more numbers, known as <b>operands</b>. Before we continue, we want to point out that any text within a slide with a light gray background, such as <code>print('hello world')</code>, is Python code. Now back to arithmetic operators:</p><ul><li> Addition Operator: <code> + </code> <ul class="code-list"> <li> <code>6 + 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Subtraction Operator: <code> - </code> <ul class="code-list"><li> <code>6 - 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Multiplication Operator: <code> * </code> <ul class="code-list"><li> <code>6 * 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Division Operator: <code> / </code> <ul class="code-list"><li> <code>6 / 2</code> </li> </ul></li> <li> Exponentiation Operator: <code> ** </code> <ul class="code-list"><li> <code>6 ** 2</code> , which is 6 to the power of 2, or 36.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to the five basic arithmetic operators above, Python supports two other, less commonly known arithmetic operators:</p><ul><li> Floor Division Operator: <code> // </code> <ul><li> This operator returns the maximum number of times that one number, lets call it x, can be evenly divided by another number, y. When we say evenly, we mean without anything left over. </li><ul class="code-list"><li><code>10 // 2</code> would return 5, as 10 can be evenly divided by 2 only 5 times: 10 = 2 x 5</li><li><code>10 // 3</code> would return 3, as 10 can be evenly divided by 3 a maximum of 3 times, and there would be a remainder of 1: 10 = (3 x 3) + 1</li><li><code>5 // 10</code> would return 0. This is a tricky one, but the reasoning is that 5 cannot be evenly divided by 10 any number of times. Another way to put is that there is no integer greater than 0 for which 10 times that integer would get you a value less than or equal to 5. So for the floor division operator, if the number to the right is greater than the number to the left, the result will always be 0.</li>
</ul></ul></li> <li> Modulus Operator: <code> % </code> <ul><li> In contrast to the floor division operator, this operator returns the remainder after attempting to divide one number, x, by another number, y. Although, if x is less than y, then the result would just be x itself.</li><ul class="code-list"><li><code>10 % 2</code> would return 0 since there is no remainder when dividing 10 by 2.</li><li><code>10 % 3</code> would return 1, as there is a remainder of 1 when dividing 10 by 3.</li> <li><code>5 % 10</code> would return 5 because 5 is less than 10.</li></ul></ul></li> </ul><p>The rules above for the floor division and modulus operators will always hold when <strong>both</strong> operands are positive. Things get weird when you start using negative numbers, and we highly doubt that you will ever have to use negative numbers with these two operators. <br><br> For arithmetic operations, the operands can be:</p><ul><li> Integers - whole numbers without a decimal point<ul><li>50, 2, -100, 5, 234 </li></ul></li> <li> Floating Point Numbers (aka Floats) - numbers with a decimal point<ul><li>1.452, 3.14, 0.75653, 123.7</li></ul></li></ul><p>There are also special cases where we can use arithmetic operators with non-numeric data, and you will learn about this later on in the course. Lastly, we can make use of multiple arithmetic operators on a combination of integers and floats, and in a single command:</p> <ul class="code-list"><li><code>5.7 * 10 - 2.5 + 3</code></li><li><code>5 ** 2 / 5 + 40.8</code></li></ul><hr class="hr-challenge"><h3 class="coding-challenge-heading"> Coding Challenge </h2> <p> When writing out a single, or sequence, of Python commands (also known as <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/sourcecode" target="_blank">source code</a>) to be executed, we usually do so in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor" target="_blank">source code editor</a>. As you have probably already noticed, there is a source code editor on the top right hand side of the screen. This is where you will write all of your code while going through the lessons. </p><p>Right below the source code editor, there is a row of buttons that you will be using quite frequently:</p><ul><li><b>Execute Code</b> - this button will execute all of the code that you have written in the source code editor, and then display the results on the bottom right hand portion of your screen. </li> <li><b>Submit Answer</b> - this button will do the same as the Execute Code button, but will also check to see if you answered the coding challenge question(s) correctly. </li> <li><b>Restore Code</b> - this is the circular, light green button to the right of the Submit Answer button. If you click it and then click Restore Code in the pop-up box that will appear, any code that you wrote and is currently in the source code editor for the slide that you are on will be replaced with the default code for that slide. The default code for a slide is either no code at all, or preset code that we create, which you will see on the screen the first time you come to a slide. </li> </ul><p>For this coding challenge, please enter the following command in the source code editor, and then press the Submit Answer button:</p> <ul><li> <code> print(20 * 3 + 150) </code></li> </ul><p>Congratulations on writing your first line of code! </p>
