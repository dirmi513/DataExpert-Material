<h2 class="slide-header">Print Expression</h2><p>For the previous slide's coding challenge, the command that you had to execute was: <code>print(20 * 3 + 150)</code>. This command utilized Pythonâ€™s built-in <code>print()</code> function (more on functions in an upcoming lesson). What happened behind the scenes? </p> <ol> <li> The interpreter performed the calculations within the parenthesis <code>20 * 3 + 150</code>. The order of operations in Python is determined by <a href= "https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html " target= "_blank ">PEMDAS</a>: <ul> <li> First, 20 was multiplied by 3 to get 60. </li> <li> Then, 150 was added that product of 60 to get the final result of 210. </li> </ul> </li> <li> The <code>print()</code> function instructed the interpreter to display the result of the calculation within its parenthesis, 210, on your screen. </li> </ol> <p> If you just entered <code>20 * 3 + 150</code> into the text editor without using <code>print()</code>, the Python interpreter would still perform the computations behind the scenes, but result would <b>not</b> be displayed on the screen. That's why we use the <code>print()</code> function. <br><br> To tell Python that you want it to perform multiple, distinct commands, you must separate each command with a new line. For example, if you want to use the print function more than once in your source code: </p> <div align= "center "> <img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/3+-+Print+Expression/print_1.png " style= "width:201px; height:181px; "> </div> <br> <p> As you can see above: </p> <ul> <li> Each distinct computation is in its own <code>print()</code> function. </li> <li> No two <code>print()</code> functions are on the same line - each one is on a new line in the text editor. Please note that it does not matter if the next <code>print()</code> function is on the next line or five lines below the previous one, as long as it's on a new line. </li> <li> The output of the source code displays the resulting value of each computation in the same order as the source code. The interpreter executes your source code line by line, starting from the top. </li> </ul> <p> If there are multiple <code>print()</code> functions on the same line, the interpreter would display the following when you try executing the code: </p> <div align= "center "> <img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/3+-+Print+Expression/print_2.png " style= "width:420px; height:142px; "> </div> <br> <p> The interpreter always tries to give us enough information to be able to dissect the issue(s) in our code. Here it's telling us: </p> <ul> <li> Which line in the source code is causing the error - <code>line 1</code>. </li> <li> The type of error - <code>SyntaxError:</code>. </li> <li> A brief description of the error - <code>invalid syntax</code>. </li> </ul> <p> We will explain what syntax is on the next slide! </p> <hr class="hr-challenge"><h3 class="coding-challenge-heading"> Coding Challenge </h2> <p> For this challenge, your task is to create source code that will display the results of the following <b>distinct</b> calculations on the screen: </p> <ul> <li> <code>(5 * 4.5) + 15</code> </li> <li> <code>10 / 3</code> </li> <li> <code>3 - 274.7 + 54</code> </li> </ul>
