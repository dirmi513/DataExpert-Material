<p>\n            Any natural language, such as English, has certain <a href=\"https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/grammar-rules-and-tips/11-rules-of-grammar.html\" target=\"_blank\"> grammar rules</a> that you must follow in order to construct valid sentences.  This is also the case for all programming languages.  Each unique programming language is analogous to a human language, and requires strict adherence to specific grammar, also known as syntax, rules.  These syntax rules define whether or not your code is properly written.  Some of the Python syntax rules that you have already come across are:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    Every distinct command must be separated by a new line in your source code.  \n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            In the previous slide, we showed you the output (a <code>SyntaxError</code>) of trying to execute code that had two consecutive <code>print()</code> statements on the same line, separated by a space.   \n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    If there's a function in your source code that you want the interpreter to execute, it must be written as follows: <code>name_of_function(function arguments)</code>.  \n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            For example, <code>print(5+ 5)</code>.  The function's name is <code>print</code>, followed by an opening parenthesis <code>(</code>, the arguments of the function (which we explain in a later lesson) <code>5 + 5</code>, and finally a closing parenthesis <code>)</code>. What would happen if we used a closing bracket instead of parenthesis?\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/4+-+Syntax/syntax_1.png\" style=\"width:421px; height:148px;\">\n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <p>\n                As you can see, the interpreter throws a <code>SyntaxError</code> when we use a bracket instead of parenthesis with the <code>print()</code> function.  Now, what if we accidentally entered a symbol that's not a valid arithmetic operator in between the two operands? \n            </p>\n            <div align=\"center\">\n                <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataexpert.images/Introduction+to+Python+Programming+for+Data+Science/Introductory+Python/4+-+Syntax/syntax_2.png\" style=\"width:421px; height:139px;\">\n            </div>\n            <br>\n            <p>\n                Another <code>SyntaxError</code>, as you might have expected.  In both of the examples above the interpreter pointed to the exact location of the syntax error in the source code.    \n            <br><br>\n                To avoid syntax errors, we must be diligent in writing our code.  We have just covered a few of Python's many syntax rules.  Although, similar to natural languages, as you become a more experienced coder in a specific programming language, writing syntactically accurate code will become effortless.  For the times that you do have syntax errors in your Python code, the interpreter will always be there to remind and show us where those errors are.\n            </p>
